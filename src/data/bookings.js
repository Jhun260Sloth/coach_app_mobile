export const FAQS = {
  client: [
    { q: "How do I book a session?", a: "Search for a coach, open their profile, choose a package, then pick a time. Your booking request will be sent to the coach for review." },
    { q: "When am I charged?", a: "Payment is requested after the coach accepts your booking request. Once you pay, funds are held securely and released to the coach after the session is confirmed complete." },
    { q: "What if I need to cancel?", a: "Open the booking from your dashboard and select Cancel or Reschedule. Refunds follow the individual coach's cancellation policy, shown at checkout." },
    { q: "How do refunds work?", a: "Approved refunds are returned to your original payment method within 5–10 business days." },
    { q: "Can I book a coach who coaches two sports?", a: "Yes! Multi-sport coaches offer distinct packages for each sport they coach. You can filter by either sport or select specific packages on their profile." },
    { q: "Is my payment information secure?", a: "Yes - CoachNivo never stores full card details. Payments are processed through an encrypted, PCI-compliant provider." },
  ],
  coach: [
    { q: "How do I get verified?", a: "Submit an identity document and, if you coach under-18s, a Working with Children Check. Most reviews complete within 2 business days." },
    { q: "Can I coach multiple sports on one profile?", a: "Yes! In Onboarding or Profile Edit, select your Primary Sport and any Secondary Sports. You can create customized packages for each sport with separate pricing and venues." },
    { q: "When do I get paid?", a: "Payouts release automatically once a client confirms a session is complete, minus CoachNivo's commission. Funds typically land in 2–3 business days." },
    { q: "Can I set my own cancellation policy?", a: "Yes - choose Flexible, Moderate or Strict from your Services tab. This is shown to clients before they book." },
    { q: "How do booking requests work?", a: "When a client sends a booking request, you review the details and choose to accept or decline. Once accepted, the client is notified to confirm and pay." },
  ],
  verification: [
    { q: "How long does verification take?", a: "Most reviews complete within 2 business days. We'll notify you the moment a decision is made - you'll also see it reflected on the verification screen." },
    { q: "What documents do I need?", a: "A government-issued photo ID plus a selfie to match it. If you coach athletes under 18, you'll also need a Working with Children Check, and an accreditation upload is required." },
    { q: "Why was my verification rejected?", a: "Usually a photo was unclear, expired, or didn't match your ID. You'll be told exactly which document failed - resubmit it from the verification screen and the review restarts." },
    { q: "Can I accept bookings while verification is pending?", a: "Not yet - your profile stays hidden until you're approved. You can keep setting up your services, availability and payouts in the meantime." },
